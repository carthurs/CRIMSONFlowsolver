1. Edit the buildoptions file and change the lines for CC,CXX,F90 to specify the names of the compilers to use.
      
2. Edit the three lines MPI_TOP, MPI_INCDIR, and MPI_LIBS to specify the location of the MPI library.  Optionally, you can use
   the mpicc,mpicxx,mpif90 commands in step 1 and leave these lines blank.
   
3. "Make" should compile the code and place an executable called flowsolver in the bin folder

4. Edit the launch script called "mysolver" in the bin folder as necessary to specify the name of the license server, the location
   of the config file (default location is the config folder in the top directory), and the path to the flowsolver executable.
