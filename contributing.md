## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Ensure that you've tested your changes. Create tests if possible - data for these should be added in the testbin folder, and can be written in one of the test source folders. For example, simple tests can be added [here](flowsolver/test/testMain.cxx), or to one of the sibling `.cxx` files. Try to place your tests in the `.cxx` which has the most appropriate name - create a new `.cxx` file if you think it necessary. We use the gtest framework. Describe the tests in your commit messages / pull request.
3. Issue that pull request!
