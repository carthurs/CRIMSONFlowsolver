\page observation_aggregator Observation Aggregator

The \ref observation_aggregator "Observation Aggregator" allows to compute
aggregated and flattened observations. The class
\link Verdandi::ObservationAggregator ObservationAggregator\endlink
is implemented in <code>ObservationAggregator.hxx</code> and
<code>ObservationAggregator.cxx</code>. It is a template class:
 <code>ObservationAggregator<T></code>. <code>T</code> is
 the numerical type (e.g., <code>double</code>).


When a <b>data assimilation method</b> requests for observations to
an <b>observation manager</b> at a given time \f$t_h\f$, it could be possible
that no observation is available at this time.

 An <b>observation manager</b> can associate to each available observation \f$y_i\f$
 a contribution \f$ \alpha_i\f$. The \ref observation_aggregator "Observation Aggregator" enables to
 compute, at each time \f$t_h\f$, the contribution of each observation according to
 several rules: 'step', 'interpolation', 'triangle'.

\section step Step interpolation

In this mode, any observation is selected if its date belongs to a left-closed and right-open interval centered on \f$t_h\f$.

\precode
aggregator = {

   type = "step",
   width_left = 0.05,
   width_right = 0.07,
    ...
\endprecode

\section interpolation Interpolation

In this mode, the closest left observation from \f$t_h\f$ and the closest
right observation are selected. The two observations are then interpolated.
One should define an observation interval. It is assumed that the
observations outside this interval have no contribution.

\precode
aggregator = {

   type = "interpolation",
   -- Observation interval.
   width_left_upper_bound = 1.,
   width_right_upper_bound = 1.,
    ...
\endprecode


\section triangle Triangle interpolation

In this mode, one should define an observation interval (left-closed and right-open). All observations
available in this interval are considered. The observations outside this interval have no contribution.
They are interpolated by a triangle
centered on \f$t_h\f$. The widths of the triangles may not be constant.

\precode
observation = {
    ...

   width_file = "configuration/width.bin",

   aggregator = {

      type = "triangle",
      width_property = "per-observation",
      -- Observation interval.
      width_left_upper_bound = 1.,
      width_right_upper_bound = 1.,
       ...
\endprecode
