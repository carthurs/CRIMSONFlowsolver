\section basic_use Basic usage

Configuration files must be written in <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/">Lua 5.1</a> and are read by the library <a href="http://gitorious.org/libops/pages/Home/">Ops</a>. Here is an example file :

\precode
-- Lines starting with "--" are comment lines.

-- This defines an integer. 
Nx = 100
-- Calculations are possible.
Ny = 2 * Nx - 10

-- This defines a floating number in double precision.
Delta_t_model = 0.03
-- Another example calculation:
Delta_t_sqrt = math.sqrt(Delta_t_model) * 1.5e-7

-- Here is a string.
output_directory = "result/"
-- Concatenation of strings is carried out by "..".
output_file = output_directory .. "output.bin"


----------------------------------- MODEL ------------------------------------


-- Configuration entries are provided in sections and subsections.
model = {

   definition = {

      -- You can provide a vector.
      initial_state = {0.3, 0.3},

      -- Binary options (Boolean).
      with_linear_term = true,
      with_constant_term = false,

      -- Reference to a previously defined entry.
      Delta_t = Delta_t_model

   }

}

-- Entries can be overwritten:
model.definition.initial_state =  {1.,
                                   1.6}
\endprecode

\section advanced_use Advanced usage

\precode
-- A list of vectors is provided as a single vector (which will be split by
-- Ops).
vector_list = {u_1, u_2, u_3,
               v_1, v_2, v_3,
               w_1, w_2, w_3}

-- Note that the following syntax is absolutely equivalent (Lua does not pay
-- attention to line breaks).
vector_list = {u_1, u_2, u_3, v_1, v_2, v_3, w_1, w_2, w_3}

-- A list of matrices is also provided as a single vector (which will be split
-- by Ops).
matrix_list = {u_11, u_12,
               u_21, u_22,
               v_11, v_12,
               v_21, v_22}
\endprecode

<code>vector_list</code> represents three vectors defined as:
\f[(u_1, u_2, u_3)^T\f]
\f[(v_1, v_2, v_3)^T\f]
\f[(w_1, w_2, w_3)^T\f]

<code>matrix_list</code> represents two matrices:
\f[\left(\begin{array}{cc}
u_{11} & u_{12}\\
u_{21} & u_{22}\\ \end{array} \right)\f]
\f[\left(\begin{array}{cc}
v_{11} & v_{12}\\
v_{21} & v_{22}\\ \end{array} \right)\f]
