%Verdandi is a generic library for data assimilation.

%Verdandi is currently developed at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a>. It aims at providing methods and tools for data assimilation. It is designed to be relevant to a large class of problems involving high-dimensional numerical models.

The library has a Python interface generated by <a href="http://www.swig.org/">Swig</a>.

\section context Scientific context 

Data assimilation is the process of combining different sources of information in order to better estimate the state of a system. By extension, some parameters can also be estimated. These methods were originally introduced to deal with uncertainties present in models pertaining mostly to geophysics, but it is now widely recognized that they have a tremendous potential in many other applications (see euHeart example below). 

Whether the system be biological, environmental, mechanical, etc., the main sources of information are always a numerical model, observations and error statistics. Data assimilation methods can be written independently of the system to which they are applied, and each method can be applied to a wide class of systems. Therefore methods are generic and can be put together in a library.

\section utility What is Verdandi for?

What is %Verdandi designed for?

<ul>
  <li> to provide data assimilation methods to non-specialists; </li>
  <li> to facilitate the application of methods to a great number of problems; </li>
  <li> to provide a framework for perennial development; </li>
  <li> to improve the diffusion and impact of data assimilation algorithms. </li>
</ul>

Who can be a %Verdandi user?

<ul>
  <li> non-specialists, engineers or researchers, who could directly use the available data assimilation methods; </li>
  <li> a specialist taking advantage of a modular framework, which should ease development, transfers and interactions. </li>
</ul>
The users provide the numerical model and the observations with the appropriate interface (see the pages \ref models and \ref observations).

\section Acknowledgment

The development of Verdandi is financially supported by the European research initiative <a href="http://www.euheart.eu/">euHeart</a> which aims at developing, sharing and integrating patient-specific multi-physics and multi-level models of the heart and great vessels in normal and pathological conditions to address  clinical challenges. In this project data assimilation is thus intended to allow the personalization of the biophysical models considered in order to perform genuinely patient-specific simulations.
