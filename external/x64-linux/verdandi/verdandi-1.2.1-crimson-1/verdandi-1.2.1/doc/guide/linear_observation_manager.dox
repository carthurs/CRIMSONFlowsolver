\page linear_observation_manager Linear Observation Manager

This observation manager defines a linear observation operator \f$\mathcal{H}_h = H\f$, where \f$H\f$ is a time-independent matrix.

The class \link Verdandi::LinearObservationManager LinearObservationManager\endlink
is implemented in <code>LinearObservationManager.hxx</code> and
<code>LinearObservationManager.cxx</code>. It is a template class:
 <code>LinearObservationManager<T></code>. <code>T</code> is
 the numerical type (e.g., <code>double</code>).

\section observation1 Management of the observations

\subsection sub11 How the observations are stored

The observations should be available in binary format. One should define the path to the file storing the observations in the configuration file :

\precode
observation = {

   file = observation_file,
    ...
\endprecode

One should also define the period with which observations are available.

At each time \f$t_h\f$, the provided observations can be an approximation of either the whole model
state \f$x^t_{h}\f$ or the observations\f$\mathcal{H}_h(x^t_h)\f$ only.

\subsection sub12 Observation contributions

When a <b>data assimilation method</b> requests for observations to the \link Verdandi::LinearObservationManager LinearObservationManager\endlink at a given time \f$t_h\f$, it is possible that no observation is available at this time.

The \link Verdandi::LinearObservationManager LinearObservationManager\endlink associates to each available observation \f$y_i\f$ a contribution \f$ \alpha_i\f$. The \ref observation_aggregator "observation aggregator" enables to compute, at each time \f$t_h\f$, the contribution \f$\alpha_i\f$ according to several rules: 'step', 'interpolation', 'triangle'.

\section observation2 Observation operator

There are two ways to define the observation operator.

One can use a Lua table to define the observation operator:

\precode
observation = {

    ...
   operator = {

        ...
      value = {1, 0, 0, 0
               0, 0, 1, 0}

   },
    ...

\endprecode

It is also possible to define the observation operator in binary format. One should define the path
to the file storing the observation operator.

\section observation3 Observation error variance

The observation error variance \f$R_h\f$ is supposed to be a scaled identity
matrix.
