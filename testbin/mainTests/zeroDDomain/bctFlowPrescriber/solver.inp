    # For zero-D BCT, we put the BCT surface index here as usual
    # But you need a bctFlowWaveform.dat in the simulation directory, containing
    # two space-separated columns. Column 1 is the time (seconds), and column 2 is the 
    # flow value at that time. Provide one complete cardiac period.
    #
    # A steady-flow version can also be used - just make a bctFlowWaveform.dat with 2 rows and 2 columns, with
    # start-time and end-time in column 1, and the same flow value in both rows of column 2.

    # so you need to eusre that you have no extra, unused surfaces in netlist_surfaces.xml
    # (e.g. if you would normally have a Netlist heart model and are testing a bct in its
    # place, then you must remove the Netlist heart from netlist_surfaces.dat first).
